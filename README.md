# LibreOffice Launchers for macOS

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

Separate, Spotlight-friendly (or Alfred, or Raycast, or etc...) .app launchers for each module in the incredible **[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)** suite on macOS.

These tiny shell-script driven apps allow you to launch **Writer**, **Calc**, **Impress**, **Draw**, **Base**, and **Math** directly — no need to open the main LibreOffice hub first. Handy for keyboard warriors.

> [!NOTE]
> These .app launchers were built using the excellent [Platypus for macOS](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) by Sveinbjörn Þórðarson.

**Tip**: You can also setup aliases in your launcher of choice in case you have Microsoft Office muscle-memory:
